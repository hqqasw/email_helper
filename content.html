<p>Dear ****,</p>

<p>
    On behalf of the Multimedia Laboratory of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK),
    we are honoured to announce the 2019 Hong Kong Computer Vision Workshop will be held on October 12, 2019 at CUHK,
    and we cordially invite you to participate in this event to share your ICCV 2019 accepted papers.
</p>

<p>
    Computer vision has been fundamental to achieve generalizable artificial intelligence for decades,
    and especially within Hong Kong, we have seen revolutionary advancements, achievements, and successes in this field.
    This event aims to offer an invaluable opportunity for Hong Kong professors, students, and researchers
    within computer vision to communicate, share, and celebrate together.
    During the workshop, globally recognized scholars and distinguished students from CUHK,
    the University of Hong Kong (HKU), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST),
    and others will be invited to share their experiences and insights through keynote speeches, poster section and panel discussions.
    Networking is especially encouraged.
</p>

<p>
    It is our pleasure to have your presence during this wonderful occasion and to give an introduction about your work accepted to ICCV 2019,
    whether through poster or oral presentation.
